# Pmod

The Pmod Connection system is using a grid of 2 rows and 6 columns of pins.

It was designed by Digilent to offer something compatible with both classical jumper wires used on breadboards,
and a standardised pinout that supports multiple protocols on the same connector.

This is popular on FPGA boards as it permits them to support any protocol over
the same connector with the right pinout, rarely possible on MCUs.

This standard is documented [here](https://reference.digilentinc.com/_media/reference/pmod/pmodoledrgb/pmodoledrgb_sch.pdf).


## Pmod Modules

There are many Pmod vendors, and this page attempts to enumerate as many as possible.

If you have made a Pmod module, let us know and we would add it to this list!
