# Getting Started

Once you receive the board, you would be able to plug via USB and see the RGB LED blinking.
This is the FPGA bitstream project loaded onto the board by default.

From here, you can:

-   Program a new FPGA design onto the iCE40: [programming the FPGA](/programming_the_fpga.html).

-   Program a custom firmware onto the RP2040: [Programming the MCU](/programming_the_mcu.html).


## Soldering the PMODs

In case you ordered the board without the Pmod connectors soldered,
you would need to solder them in to plug something onto the board.
For instance like this:
